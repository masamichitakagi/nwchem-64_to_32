## Real-time TDDFT restart example.
##
## File 1 of 2.
##
## Na atom under dummy continuous wave excitation.
## 
## Example consists of two input decks:
##
## 1: Runs simulation to completion for a short tmax
##    and saves restart files along the way.
##
## 2: Runs another simulation with longer tmax starting
##    from previously saved restart file.
##
## How to generate dipole moment:
## (a) na1.nw => na1.nwo => z1.dat
## (b) na2.nw => na2.nwo => z2.dat
## (c) cat z1.dat z2.dat > zboth.dat
##
## Practically you would likely keep the old .nwo file
## and re-run the same input deck but with "load vectors" added.
## 
## Note: Do NOT use the top-level "restart" option, instead
## "start" a new run every time and let the RT-TDDFT read in
## the self-contained run.rt_restart file
